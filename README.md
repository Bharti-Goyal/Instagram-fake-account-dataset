# Research Project: Fake Profile Detection on Instagram

# Introduction
This research project, conducted by Bharti Goyal, focuses on the detection of fake profiles on Instagram. Fake profiles, also known as bots or sock puppets, pose significant challenges to online trustworthiness and security. The aim of this research is to develop effective algorithms for identifying fake profiles on Instagram, thereby contributing to the mitigation of social media manipulation and fraudulent activities.

# Dataset
